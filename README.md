    Q:Introduce Yourself...

A: My name is Bemnet kassahun. I am in my junior year of highschool and enrolled in Nazareth School. I am 17 years old soon to be 18 tho :). I am a very determined student and always try my best to achieve the things I put my mind onto. And most importantly focus on doing things that make me happy and give me satisfaction rather than doing things for recognition or because it’s a trend, or it’s a norm.</p>
    <p>Q: Tell us how you think other people would describe you?<br>

A: Well, I think people (that know me well) if they are asked about me the first thing that come to mind will be most probably funny, outgoing, extrovert and some others might describe me as like quiet and introverted because I am not hyper all the time I adjust to the environment and to the kind of people I am with.</p>
    <p>Q: What is your biggest strength?<br>

A: My biggest strength I would say is my determination towards a thing I want to achieve. If there is a thing I have to finish or a deadline approaching, I will do anything to finish it in order not to disappoint “myself”.</p>
    <p>Q: What are the things you like to do excluding school stuff?<br>

A: I enjoy reading different kind of books, watching different videos be it motivational videos, space exploration videos, funny videos…</p>
    <p>Q: Is there anything you want to say to people around your age?<br>

A: I mostly see teenagers worrying too much about the future, not only about the future but also thinking that they are not unique and start comparing others’ life, progress and achievement to ours but we shouldn’t do that, i advise peers to focus on themselves and on what maes them happy, surround themselves with positive energy, avoid people who drain their energy, and to meditate. Just stop stressing and enjoy life at the same time being productive and leading a well-planned life. Be happy and true to yourself!!</p></div>

    <h1><u> Works of the individual</u></h1>
    <h3><i><u>Puagmae Festival</u></i></h3>
<p>
Puagmae festival is an event held during the special thirteenth month of the Ethiopian calendar. Bemnet participated as a volunteer in this event.<br>

” I took part in this event because i belive that inadequate promotion of culture is the sources of conflict in Ethiopia due to given small attention. And what better way to contribute in promoting our culture than being a member of an organizing team of this cultural festival.” —Bemnet—<br>

” Although this festival lacked promotion and not many people know about it, I was happy to take part in the event. Those six days were indeed one of the best experiences of my life. It made me see how much of a diverse our country is and how beautiful and unique every culture is. Because I travel little the only knowledge of different Ethiopian culture that I had was through TV or books and other things like that, however when I volunteered in this event I was able to experience different cultures first hand. I was able to taste the food, meet people from different parts of the country, learn cultural dances, and more amazing things” —Bemnet—<br> </P>
